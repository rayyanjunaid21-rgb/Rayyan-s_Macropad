# Rayyan-s_Macropad
Just a cool macropad
It has 6 keys and a rotary encoder, all connected to the Seeed Studio Xiao

## PCB
Here's a picture of my PCB and Schematics:

## BOM
For this project, I would need:
- 6 Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 6 MX-Style switches
- 1 EC11 Rotary encoder
- 6 Blank DSA keycaps
- 4 M3x16mm screws
- 4 M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts
- Soldering Iron
